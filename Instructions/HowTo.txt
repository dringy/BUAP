How to use my project:
Run the ASP.net Server Code in the same folder, you will need an ASP.net server or something to simulate it such
as Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2012 on University Machines will work).

The plugin requires a full Minecraft server. You will need to install the server from here:
http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/     (Use recommender build)
I have included a folder named MC Server, place this folder on
your computer and double click on run.bat with the server Jar file in the same directory
My plugin will be included in the plugin folder. Please note
the run.bat and Minecraft Server was not written by me but the plugin was.

The SQL server is needed to be installed. I used Windows SQL Express 2012 found at this URL:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=29062
Once installed you will need to add a database that uses Windows Authentication.
The plugin is designed to cope with a database named: BathCSAdvancedProject
and an instance named: SQLEXPRESS
So please use these names, it is also designed to work locally.
On your computer manager ensure the SQL server for SQLEXPRESS is running
and TCP/IP Protocol is enabled.

You will need to install the JDBC driver (included in the folder JDBC), copy this driver into your java environment
for me it was C:\Windows\System32

To run the Website simply run PlayerList.aspx.vb through the ASP.net server (or Visual Studio)

To run the server and thus the plugin double click on run.bat

You will need to run all the SQL queries onto the database, included in the original upload. 
I do this using Visual Studio Server Explorer.

It is important to note that this program was designed for personal use, and not to be easily portable.
